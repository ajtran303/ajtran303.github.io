      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>As a career changer with a background in the restaurant industry, I
        discovered a passion for coding and spent five years
        learning as much as I could through self-study and free resources. I
        even had the opportunity to teach coding to kids in
        after school programs on a part-time basis.</p>

      <p>However, it wasn't until I enrolled in the <a
          href="https://turing.edu/" target="_blank">Turing School of Software
          and Design's coding bootcamp</a> that I truly fell in
        love with software engineering. The immersive experience allowed me to
        learn more in seven months than I had in my
        previous five years of self-study.</p>

      <p>After graduation, I began my career as a Software Development
        Instructor before transitioning to a role as a Software
        Engineer. While I enjoy engineering, I also have a deep passion for
        teaching and hope to return to the classroom
        someday.</p>

      <p>If you have a unique opportunity that aligns with my skills and
        interests, please don't hesitate to reach out to me at
        <a href="mailto:ajtrandev@gmail.com">ajtrandev@gmail.com</a>.</p>
