        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>As a career changer with a background in the restaurant industry, I
          discovered a passion for coding and spent five years
          learning as much as I could through self-study and free resources. I
          even had the opportunity to teach coding to kids in
          after school programs on a part-time basis.</p>

        <p>However, it wasn't until I enrolled in the <a
            href="https://turing.edu/" target="_blank">Turing School of Software
            and Design's coding bootcamp</a> that I truly fell in
          love with software engineering. The immersive experience allowed me to
          learn more in seven months than I had in my
          previous five years of self-study.</p>

        <p>After graduation, I began my career as a Software Development
          Instructor before transitioning to a role as a Software
          Engineer. While I enjoy engineering, I also have a deep passion for
          teaching and hope to return to the classroom
          someday.</p>

        <p>If you have a unique opportunity that aligns with my skills and
          interests, please don't hesitate to reach out to me at
          <a href="mailto:ajtrandev@gmail.com">ajtrandev@gmail.com</a>.</p>

        <h2>Blog</h2>

        <p>The contents of the following articles were procedurally generated
          and do not represent my writing. This website is a playground for
          exploring front end technologies that I'm not usually exposed to in my
          work. In addition to using lorem ipsum, I generated some blog posts
          using ChatGPT so that I could focus on the underlying technologies
          like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript rather than content.</p>
