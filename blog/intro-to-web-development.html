      <h1 class="text-center">Intro to Web Development</h1>

      <p>
        Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites. It
        involves a combination of front-end and back-end technologies, and
        requires a range of skills and knowledge to create functional and
        visually appealing websites. In this blog post, we'll take a look at the
        three fundamental technologies that are essential for web development:
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
      </p>

      <p>
        HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language for
        creating web pages. It provides the structure and content for a website,
        including headings, paragraphs, lists, and links. HTML uses tags to
        identify and describe the different elements on a web page. For example,
        the &lt;h1&gt; tag is used to create a main heading, and the &lt;p&gt;
        tag is used to create a paragraph.
      </p>

      <p>
        CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to
        describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. It
        allows developers to specify how different elements on a web page should
        be displayed, such as their color, font, size, and layout. CSS can be
        used to create a consistent design across multiple pages on a website,
        and can be easily changed to update the look and feel of a website.
      </p>

      <p>
        JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used to add
        interactive elements to websites. It allows developers to create dynamic
        content, such as form validation, image sliders, and pop-up windows.
        JavaScript is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create more
        complex web applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        While HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the core technologies of web
        development, there are many other tools and technologies that are
        commonly used in the field. These include web development frameworks,
        databases, server-side languages, and version control systems. However,
        a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is essential for any
        web developer, and is a good starting point for those who are new to the
        field.

        development by creating a simple static website. Stay tuned!
