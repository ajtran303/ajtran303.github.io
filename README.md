This is my playground for trying out technologies that I don't usually get to play with at work, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I used ChatGPT to generate the initial blog posts because the generated content looks better than a bunch of Lorem Ipsum.

In the future, I would like to write my own blog posts. I'm just not quite sure about what kind of content I would like to blog about. On the one hand, I'd like to help people learn about software development. On the other hand, I personally am finding an interest in personal finance and would like to share information about my journey in that regard.
